# Zanclean-flooding-Mediterranean-evolution-
Mediterranean evolution during and after the Zanclean megaflood, which refilled the desiccated Mediterranean during Messinian Salinity Crisis (MSC).

# Two main phases
Flooding Phase - Computes Western and Eastern Mediterranean (wMed and eMed) evolution during the Zanclean flood
Evolving Phase - Computes salt removal and basin evolution of eMed in the flood aftermath

In a sensitivity test, we address a rival hypothesis - Refilling of a almost-filled Mediterranean.

There are 14 scripts in total (10 for basin refilling & evolution, 1 for post-flood evolution, 3 for the sensitivity test)

These files have been named as Script 1, Script 2,.... Script 14.
Follow this order to completely run the model.

All the data files required to run the scripts (in text format) are provided.
Apart from hypsometry files, all other data files can be produced while running the scripts.
Use numpy.savetxt function to save the files if necessary.
